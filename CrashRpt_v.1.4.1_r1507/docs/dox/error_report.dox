\page error_report About an Error Report

When an error occurs in a client application, CrashRpt notifies the end user and allows him/her
to review the report contents. CrashRpt can be configured to use multiple languages with its user
interface, as described in \ref internationalization_support.

\section maindlg Error Report Dialog

When a crash occurs in the client application, the <b>Error Report</b> 
dialog is displayed (see the figure below).

User can optionally provide his/her E-mail address and a short problem 
description. He can do this by clicking the 
"Provide additional information (recommended)" link. 

The user-entered E-mail address may be used later by software support staff to
contact the user and ask for additional information about the problem.

Once the user is satisfied, he/she may click the 'Send report' 
button on the Error Report dialog. For additional information about sending error reports,
please refer to \ref sending_error_reports page.

If the user doesn't want to send the report, the user clicks the 'Close the program' button.

\section detaildlg Error Report Details Dialog

The <i>What does this report contain?</i> link on the Error Report dialog
opens the Error Report Details dialog.

The <b>Error Report Details</b> dialog (see below) displays the list of files 
contained in the crash report. Double clicking a filename opens the file using 
its associated program, if an association exists for the file type. 

Pressing the <i>Export...</i> button results in exporting the error report files 
as a ZIP archive. This may be useful if you want to save a local copy of the error 
report to disc for later use.

Software vendors who care about user's privacy, may provide a privacy policy file describing 
what user information your software collects 
on crash. You provide the URL of your privacy policy file published on your web site 
or distributed with your software. If you need a template for the privacy policy file, 
you may use this one: 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/crashrpt/wiki/PrivacyPolicyTemplate">PrivacyPolicyTemplate</a>. 

\section what_does_error_report_contain What does Error Report Contain?

The error report is a collection of files intended to help the developer 
diagnose the cause of the crash: a crash minidump file, a crash description XML file,
and other optional files. 

A crash minidump file (<i>crashdump.dmp</i>) contains operating system 
version, processor type, CPU registers state, local variables and call stack for each 
execution thread. The minidump in most cases can be used on developer's side to determine 
the reason of the crash and try to fix the problem.

CrashRpt generates an XML crash description file (<i>crashrpt.xml</i>). The file contains various
information, such as application name and version, sender's E-mail address and geographic 
location, user-provided problem description, exception type and address and so on.

Custom files, for example, application log files, desktop screen shots and screen capture videos, can be included 
into crash report via the API functions provided by CrashRpt. For additional information,
see the \ref using_crashrpt_api page.
